# Grilling Project README 

## How to use this project
### Requirements
- The ability to run C++ code


<br/>

### Instructions
- To install, simply download the code to a file of your choice, and access the file where you put the code
- Compile and run the code
- Type the answer to the prompts in the terminal and select your enter key.
- Note: Do not insert any extra spaces in your answers to the prompts. There is some flexibility with slight variations to inputs, but spaces really mess with the system.

### Prompts
- The program will ask you five questions:
    - What type of steak are you grilling?
    - How well done do you want your steak?
    - Approximately how thick are the  steaks you are preparing (in inches)?
    - Will you be seasoning your steak yourself?
    - How many people will be eating steak?
